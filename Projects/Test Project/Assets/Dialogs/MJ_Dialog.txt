One day, I'll be a hero like Incrum! Except not weird.
I heard Incrum once fought the the COOLEST bear.
Incrum can scare small children, with just his voice.
Incrum was picked on a lot by the monks and party.
Maybe I don't really want to be like Incrum...
I want to be like the bear with the red hat!
