Add the PlayerController script to the player character and the camera.  This will allow basic WASD movement for the character and have the camera follow the character.
To add the script :
	Add the PlayerController.cs to your Unity project.
	Click on the player object (or camera) and click add component.
	Go to scripts and you should see the PlayerController script.  Click to add.
	Do the same to the Camera object.
	Click play and enjoy the stupid simplicity of it.
